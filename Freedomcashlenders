 As you get quotes for personal loans, be sure to read through the fine print. You're specifically looking for the interest or annual percentage rates (APR) and the fees associated with the loan. For instance, some lenders charge origination fees for setting up the loan for you. Take all the fees into account since they can drive up the cost of the loan.

Be aware that borrowers with high credit scores earn the best interest rates, but that doesn't mean you can't get a personal loan with bad credit. You'll probably just pay more in interest if you do qualify.
