If you're applying for a personal or home equity loan, you'll usually have to give the previous documentation and give the lender permission to perform a credit check. You can usually fill out the loan application online, especially if you're working with a big bank, credit union, or digital bank. Once you click submit, the lender will review your details.

If you're hoping to get a payday or title loan, head to the closest payday or title loan business (if they operate in your state) and provide the information in person or find out if they offer online services. Again, it's better to pursue other emergency funding, so it's easier to repay the loan.
